/**
 * @author Mike Dietz - 2022
 * THIS MODULE IS A HANDCODED EXAMPLE. The objective is to demonstrate differences between abstract classes and abstract interfaces. 
 * The entity example demonstrates the principle of tightly coupled contract.
 * The REST interface example demonstrates the loosely-coupled flexibility of multiple interfaces.
 * The module can freely be extended or modified.
